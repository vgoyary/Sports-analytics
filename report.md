# Technical Report: Player Re-identification and Tracking System

## Executive Summary

This report documents the development of a comprehensive player tracking and re-identification system for sports videos. The system combines YOLO-based object detection with custom tracking algorithms to maintain persistent player identities across video frames, handling challenges like occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid movements typical in sports scenarios.

## 1. Approach and Methodology

### 1.1 System Architecture

The system employs a multi-stage pipeline approach:

1. **Detection Stage**: YOLO-based multi-class object detection
2. **Feature Extraction**: ResNet18-based appearance feature extraction
3. **Tracking Stage**: Custom multi-object tracking with re-identification
4. **Visualization**: Real-time annotation and statistics overlay

### 1.2 Core Design Philosophy

**Modular Design**: Each component (detection, tracking, feature extraction, visualization) is isolated for maintainability and testing.

**Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic confidence thresholds based on object type and tracking stability to balance precision and recall.

**Feature-Rich Re-identification**: Combines multiple similarity metrics (appearance, motion, IoU) for robust track association.

### 1.3 Technical Stack

- **Detection Framework**: Ultralytics YOLO v8
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch with pre-trained ResNet18
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing
- **Numerical Computing**: NumPy, SciPy for mathematical operations
- **Distance Metrics**: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, IoU

## 2. Techniques Implemented and Outcomes

### 2.1 Multi-Class Object Detection

**Implementation**: Custom YOLO model trained for sports-specific classes:
- Class 0: Ball
- Class 1: Goalkeeper  
- Class 2: Player
- Class 3: Referee

**Configuration Optimizations**:
```python
model.overrides['conf'] = 0.2      # Lower global threshold
model.overrides['iou'] = 0.4       # Reduced NMS threshold
model.overrides['max_det'] = 50    # Increased detection limit
```

**Outcome**: 
- ✅ Successfully detects multiple object types simultaneously
- ✅ Adaptive confidence thresholds improve detection quality
- ✅ Handles crowded scenes with up to 50 simultaneous objects

### 2.2 ResNet18-Based Feature Extraction

**Implementation**: Pre-trained ResNet18 with ImageNet weights, modified for sports tracking:
- Removed final classification layer
- Added object-specific transforms
- Implemented stability modes (clean vs. augmented)

**Transform Pipeline**:
```python
# Players: 128x64 aspect ratio
# Ball: 64x64 square aspect ratio
# Augmentation: ColorJitter for robustness
# Normalization: ImageNet statistics
```

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Robust appearance features for similar-looking players
- ✅ Object-specific sizing improves feature quality
- ✅ Stability modes reduce tracking jitter

### 2.3 Multi-Metric Tracking Algorithm

**Implementation**: Custom tracking system combining:
- **Appearance Similarity**: Cosine distance between ResNet features
- **Motion Prediction**: Velocity-based position estimation
- **Spatial Proximity**: IoU-based spatial relationship
- **Track Stability**: Age-based adaptive thresholds

**Scoring Function**:
```python
score = (0.5 * appearance_sim + 0.3 * motion_sim + 0.2 * iou_sim)
# Age bonus for stable tracks
score -= min(track.age * 0.01, 0.1)
```

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Significant reduction in ID switches
- ✅ Improved handling of temporary occlusions
- ✅ Better performance in crowded scenes

### 2.4 Re-identification System

**Implementation**: Two-tier re-identification approach:
1. **Active Tracking**: Real-time matching for visible objects
2. **Inactive Recovery**: Historical feature matching for re-appearing objects

**Feature History Management**:
- Maintains 5 recent features per track
- Uses feature averaging for stable matching
- Implements separate thresholds for active vs. inactive tracks

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Successfully re-identifies players after brief occlusions
- ✅ Maintains track continuity across scene changes
- ✅ Reduces false positive re-identifications

### 2.5 Adaptive Thresholding System

**Implementation**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on:
- Object type (ball vs. player vs. goalkeeper)
- Track stability (age-based adjustment)
- Scene complexity (detection density)

**Threshold Examples**:
```python
confidence_thresholds = {
    'ball': 0.2,        # Very sensitive (small object)
    'player': 0.25,     # Balanced for main subjects
    'goalkeeper': 0.25, # Same as player
    'referee': 0.3      # Slightly higher (less critical)
}
```

**Outcome**:
- ✅ Improved detection rates for small objects (ball)
- ✅ Reduced false positives for less critical objects
- ✅ Better overall system balance

## 3. Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### 3.5 Challenge: Track Stability vs. Adaptability

**Problem**: Balancing stable tracking with ability to adapt to appearance changes.

**Initial Approach**: Fixed similarity thresholds.
**Limitation**: Either too rigid (missed re-IDs) or too flexible (false matches).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Age-based adaptive thresholds
- Feature history with weighted averaging
- Separate handling for active vs. inactive tracks
- Confidence-based track validation

**Result**: Improved both tracking stability and adaptability.
